This app is was constructed with create-react-app, redux, react-router-dom and firebase. It is a personal project. It is meant to allow tennis players find tennis courts within a ten mile radius of their desired location. It also helps them find other people to play tennis with. The user must set up an account to see other users. Currently the user can only view other users. The ability to contact them may come in later versions. The user can also add frequently used tennis courts to their list of favorite courts in their account. There is one minor bug regarding viewing the court map from the favorites page. A fix will come soon.
